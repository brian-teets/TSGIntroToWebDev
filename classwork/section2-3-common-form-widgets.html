    <h1>2.3 Common HTML Form Widgets</h1>
    <h2>Checkbox</h2>
    <p>
      A <strong>checkbox</strong> is a widget for input elements with the type attribute of "checkbox", which allows users to check, or select, a value.
      A checkbox initially appears selected if the checked attribute is set. Ex: &lt;input type="checkbox" checked&gt; creates a checked checkbox. The
      <strong>checked attribute</strong> is an example of a <strong>boolean attribute</strong>. A boolean attribute is an attribute that is true when present and
      false when absent. No value must be assigned to a boolean attribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each checkbox selected, the browser sends the checkbox's name and value to the server. If the value attribute is not specified, the default value of
      "on" is sent. If a checkbox is not selected, the browser does not send anything to the server. A <u>common error</u> on the server is failing to record all
      checkboxes in the form as the browser doesn't report any values for checkboxes not selected by the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Good practice</u> is to use label elements with checkboxes so the user can click the label to check and uncheck the associated checkbox.

    <h2>Radio button</h2>
    <p>
      A <strong>radio button</strong> is a widget for input elements with the type attribute of "radio", which allows users to select exactly one value from
      possibly many values. The web browser groups radio buttons together with the same name attribute, where each possible value in a group has an associated
      input. When submitting a form, the browser sends the selected radio button's name and value attribute. Ex: If the radio button &lt;input type="radio"
      name="movie" value="ET"&gt; is selected, "movie=ET" is sent to the server.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main difference between a radio button and checkbox is that only one radio button in a group can be selected, while any number of checkboxes can
      be selected.

    <h2>Drop-down menu</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>&lt;select&gt;</strong> opening and closing tags create a <strong>drop-down menu</strong> (or <strong>drop-down list</strong>), which allows
      users to select one of several predefined values. The <strong>&lt;option&gt;</strong> opening and closing tags create a value, or option, the user can
      select within a drop-down menu. When the user is not interacting with the menu, the drop-down menu usually displays the selected option.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference between a drop-down menu and a radio button widget is that the drop-down menu only displays the options when interacting with the user,
      while a radio button widget always displays all options.
