      <h1>4.3 Positioning Elements</h1>
      <h2>position property</h2>
      <p>
        The CSS position property gives developers more control over where elements should appear in the browser. position has four possible values:
      </p>

      <!-- Frustratingly, there were virtually no specific instructions on participation activity 4-3-7. I figured it out by inspecting the expected
       web page and duplicating the position and z-index properties. The CSS in the exercise didn't even include all of the classes. It only included
        .heart and .words . -->
       <!--
       .heart {
          color: red;
          font-size: 65pt;
          position: absolute;
          left: 150;
          top: 45px;
          z-index: 4;

      <!-- Note: I've been taking a lot of extra time duplicating all of the text and taking copious screenshots from each lesson.
        I need to make up a lot of time so I don't have to push out my Java course start date again, so I need to take a lot less notes.
        So, I'm going to try to just take very minimal notes for each lesson from now on. -Jan 13, 2022 -->
