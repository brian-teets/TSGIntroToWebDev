          <h3>Elevation</h3>
          <p>
            When you come to Colorado, one thing you'll notice is that the green signs displaying the name of the town or city you're entering doesn't include the
            population number. Instead, you'll see the location's elevation. The elevation as listed in wikipedia is 5,351 feet above sea level, although the
            elevation where my house is located is almost 500 feet higher.

          <h3>Population</h3>
          <p>
            According to 2020 census numbers, the population of Littleton is 45,652. But, with all the traffic around here, that number seems really low to me!

          <h3>Weather</h3>
          <p>

            Littleton. The US average is 205 sunny days. Littleton averages 69 inches of snow per year. The US average is 28 inches of snow per year. But, don't
            worry, because as one funny meme went, <strong>"Welcome to Colorado where the where the weather is made up and the seasons don't matter!"</strong>.
