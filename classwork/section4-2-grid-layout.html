      <h1>4.2 Grid layout</h1>
      <h2>Grid container and grid items</h2>
      <p>
        The justify-content and align-content properties have no effect unless the grid width or height is less than the grid container's width or height.

      <!-- Note: I've been taking a lot of extra time duplicating all of the text and taking copious screenshots from each lesson.
        I need to make up a lot of time so I don't have to push out my Java course start date again, so I need to take a lot less notes.
        So, I'm going to try to just take very minimal notes for each lesson from now on. -Jan 13, 2022 -->
