        Needtobreathe is an American rock band that blurs the lines between mainstream and Christian rock, and that is further demonstrated in their band name.
        Needtobreathe's band name is based on a Greek parable by Socrates related to seeking God. The original lineup formed in South Carolina where they started
        writing and recording independently in the early 2000's. They released their first studio album, <em>Daylight</em> released in 2006. Fast forward to 2020.
        A lot has changed in the dynamic of the band with some of the original band members leaving the group, including beloved member, Bo Rinehart prior to the
        release of their seventh studio album, <em>Out of Body</em> in June of 2020. And one of their songs from that album titled "Seasons" is also the namesake
        of this fan made web page. It's such a beautiful song that embodies the ups and downs of our lives, and there's a symmetry between the song writers and
        their audience in this song.
