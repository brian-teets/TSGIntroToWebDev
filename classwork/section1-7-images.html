      The img tag displays an image in a web page. The img tag does not enclose any content and is therefore a void element with no closing tag. The img tag
      has two common attributes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The scr attribute is the mandatory attribute that specifies the URL of the image file to display</li>
      <li>The alt attribute provides a text description to use as an alternative to displaying the image</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Ex: <img src="http://example.com/family.jpg" alt="Smith family reunion"> displays the image family.jpg, but the text "Smith family reunion" displays
      if the image cannot be displayed.
    </p>

      Image formats
    </p>
    <p>
      Web browsers support 3 popular image formats:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) image format is commonly used for digital photographs.</li>
      <li>The PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format is commonly used for line art, screenshots, or images requiring transparency.</li>
      <li>The GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) image format is commonly used for simple animated images.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      All three formats use data compression to decrease the image file size, which allows the file to be transferred over the internet quicker. JPEG images
      use lossy compression, meaning that some of the original picture information is lost when compressed. A photograph is best saved as a JPEG image
      because humans cannot easily perceive the quality loss in a photograph. PNG and GIF images use lossless compression, meaning no image quality is lost.
      Lossless compression works best when a large number of adjacent pixels are the same color.
    </p>
    <p>
      JPEG and PNG images can display true color (24-bit color), which is approximately 16 million different colors. GIF images are limited to only 256
      colors (8-bit color), but GIF images can display animations, which are popular on social media.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less common image formats include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The APNG image format by Mozilla adds animation capability to PNG with true color support.</li>
      <li>The SVG image format is an XML format that describes an image as a series of shapes and lines.</li>
      <li>The WebP image format by Google supports true color, transparency, and animation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Favicon: A favicon is a small icon that identifies a website and typically displays in a browser tab. A favicon can be any image format (JPEG, PNG,
      GIF) and any size. PNG is a popular favicon format because a PNG can have transparent pixels.
    </p>
    <p>
    <img src="1-7-7-favicon.png" alt="favicon">
    </p>
    <p>
      A favicon is defined with a link tag, which defines a link between a web page and an external resource. <br>
      <img src="1-7-8-favicon-link-example.png" alt="favicon link">
