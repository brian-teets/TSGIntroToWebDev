          <h2>Restaurant Description</h2>
          <p>
            <!-- Pine Junction Grill is fictitious. But, I really like Pine and Confier Colorado, and I based my fake restaurant on
              a few real restaurants in that area. One that I've visited is Snowpack in Conifer. -->
            Come grab a burger and hang out with your friends on our outdoor patio. There's nothing better than good food with your friends while taking in an
            amazing view of the front range!
          </p>
          <p>
            We have many local beers on tap as well as hard ciders and localally distilled whiskeys and gins. Flights are availble as well!
