          <h2>Restaurant Description</h2>
          <p>
            <!-- Pine Junction Grill is fictitious. But, I really like Pine and Confier Colorado, and I based my fake restaurant on
              a few real restaurants in that area. One that I've visited is Snowpack in Conifer. -->
            Come grab a burger and hang out with your friends on our outdoor patio. There's nothing better than good food with your friends while taking in an
            amazing view of the front range!
          </p>
          <p>
            We have many local beers on tap as well as hard ciders and localally distilled whiskeys and gins. Flights are available as well!

          <!-- A couple of notes on links for me to remember: regarding a:visited, the visited attributes/colors will persist even if the page has
            been refreshed; if you add new links, those will remain the default anchor color/attributes until clicked and visited; if the link
              is broken or unreachable, then the link will not be considered as visited yet; if the user clears browser cache and browser history and
              clears cache and browser history preceding before when the link was visited, then those particular links will return to default a attributes;
              if a link was visited prior to the chosen time range of clearing the browser history and cache, then the user will still see a link or links
              display with visited attributes.-->
